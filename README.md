# Handwritten-Digit-Classification
A machine learning project using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. Includes data preprocessing, neural network design with 2 dense layers, model training, and evaluation. Features real-time visualizations for predictions and performance analysis.
This project focuses on building and training a neural network to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset. The model was implemented with TensorFlow and Keras and demonstrates the basics of neural networks for multi-class classification.

Overview
The MNIST dataset is a benchmark dataset for image classification, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is a 28x28 grayscale pixel array representing a single digit.

**Key highlights of the project:**

Dataset Preprocessing: Normalized pixel values and flattened images for optimal input to the neural network.
Model Architecture: Implemented a two-layer neural network using the TensorFlow Sequential API.
Evaluation: Achieved high accuracy in predicting digit labels on the test dataset.
Features
Handwritten digit recognition with real-time visualization of predictions.
Preprocessing pipeline for image normalization and flattening.
Neural network training and evaluation using TensorFlow and Keras.
Interactive visualizations for understanding predictions.
